[2022-02-14 13:18:43.010259]: People simply will not agree on what should and shouldn't be "an error", and once exception-handling mechanisms are introduced to give people a choice, they will far less agree on what to do with them., Tim Peters, 17 Dec 1993

[2022-02-18 12:09:50.365471]: "Python tricks" is a tough one, cuz the language is so clean. E.g., C makes an art of confusing pointers with arrays and strings, which leads to lotsa neat pointer tricks; APL mistakes everything for an array, leading to neat one-liners; and Perl confuses everything period, making each line a joyous adventure <wink>., Tim Peters, 16 Sep 1993

Then it takes only an hour to extend the script to 300 lines, after which it still does almost what you want., Jack Jansen, 8 Jul 1992
